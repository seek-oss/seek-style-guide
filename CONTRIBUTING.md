# Contributing to seek-style-guide

## Workflow

We follow the pull request model for all changes to the style guide, even for core contributors. All pull requests must be reviewed by someone else before merging.

## Versioning

This package follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org). New versions are published automatically from [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).

In order to automatically increment version numbers correctly, commit messages must follow the [AngularJS commit message convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-git-commit-guidelines). To make this easier, you can use [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to guide you through the commit process by running `npm run commit` from the command line.
